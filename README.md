# React Native Third-Party Library Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: incompatibility between third-party libraries and the current React Native version or other dependencies.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` presents potential solutions.

## Problem Description

Integrating third-party libraries can be tricky.  Version mismatches or dependency conflicts can lead to unexpected behavior, application crashes, or build failures. This is a typical scenario that often requires careful dependency management and version control.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the `README` file (if any).
3. Run the application. You should encounter an error or unexpected behavior as described in `bug.js` comments.

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates solutions for resolving the compatibility issue.  Possible solutions include:

* **Updating dependencies:** Ensure all libraries are compatible with the current React Native version.
* **Checking compatibility:** Review the documentation of each library for compatibility information.
* **Using alternative libraries:** If a library is outdated or incompatible, consider using an alternative.
* **Resolving dependency conflicts:** Utilize package managers like npm or yarn to manage dependencies effectively and resolve conflicts.
