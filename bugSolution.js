// Solution 1: Update incompatible library
npm install <library_name>@latest

// Solution 2: Use a compatible alternative
import { AlternativeLibrary } from 'alternative-library'; // Replace with appropriate import

// Solution 3: Resolve dependency conflict (example with npm)
npm install --force

// Solution 4:  Ensure all dependencies align with the correct React Native version
// Refer to the documentation for your third-party libraries and the official React Native documentation for compatibility information.

// Solution 5: Check for warnings in your packager output.  Sometimes warnings may indicate compatibility issues that need attention even if your app doesn't immediately crash.
